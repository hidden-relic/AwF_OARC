- Factorio role system to manage custom permissions.
@core Roles
@alias Roles

@usage--- Using Role System (assignment):
--When a map first starts you will want to define on mass all the players you expect to join and the roles to give them:
Roles.override_player_roles{
    Cooldude2606 = {'Owner', 'Admin', 'Member'},
    NotCooldude2606 = {'Member'}
}

--Once the game is running you still want to be able to give role and remove them which is when you would use:
Roles.assign_player(player, 'Admin', by_player_name) -- this will give the "Admin" role to the player
Roles.unassign_player(player, {'Admin', 'Moderator'}, by_player_name) -- this will remove "Admin" and "Moderator" role in one go

@usage--- Using Role System (role testing):
--To comparer two players you can comparer the index of they highest roles, can be used when you want to allow a "write" down type system:
Roles.get_player_highest_role(playerOne).index < Roles.get_player_highest_role(playerTwo).index -- remember that less means a higher role

--Listing all of a players roles can also be useful which is when you would want to use:
Roles.get_player_roles(player) -- the return is an array that can be looped over however this is not in particular order

--Finally you may want to test if a player has a certain role, flag or action allowed which is when you would use:
Roles.player_has_role(player, 'Admin') -- you can provide a role name if you only want a name based system
Roles.player_has_flag(player, 'is_donator') -- your roles can be grouped together with flags such as is_donator
Roles.player_allowed(player, 'game modifiers') -- or you can have an action based system where each action is something the player can do

@usage--- Example Flag Define:
--Flags can be used to group multiple roles and actions under one catch all, for example if you want a piece of code to only
--be active for your donators then you would add a "is_donator" flag to all your donator roles and then in the code test if
--a player has that tag present:

-- give you donators a speed boost when they join; these functions aren't required but can be useful
Roles.define_flag_trigger('is_donator', function(player, state)
    if state then
        player.character_running_speed_modifier = 1.5
    else
        player.character_running_speed_modifier = 1
    end
end)

-- then on all your donator roles you would add
Roles.new_role('Donator')
:set_flag('is_donator')

-- and in your code you would test for
if Roles.player_has_flag(player, 'is_donator') then
    -- some donator only code
end

@usage--- Example Role Define:
--You can't use a role system without any roles so first you must define your roles; each role has a minimum of a name with
--the option for a shorthand:
Roles.new_role('Administrator', 'Admin')

--Next you will want to add any extras you want to have, such as a tag, colour, permission group or any custom flags:
Roles.new_role('Administrator', 'Admin')
:set_custom_tag('[Admin]')
:set_custom_color('red') -- this can be {r=0, g=0, b=0} or a predefined value
:set_permission_group('Staff') -- a second argument can be added if you have not used the custom permission group config
:set_flag('is_admin')

--You will then want to decide if you want to allow all actions, this should of course be used sparely:
Roles.new_role('Administrator', 'Admin')
...extras...
:set_allow_all()

--If you don't do this want this as i would advise you do then you will want to define what the role can do; this comes with
--an optional inheritance system if you like those sort of things in which case disallow may also be of some use to you:
Roles.new_role('Administrator', 'Admin')
...extras...
:set_parent('Moderator') -- the admin can do anything that a moderator can do
:allow{ -- these actions can be anything just try to keep them without conflicts
    'command/kill',
    'gui/game settings'
}

--Here is what the finished admin role would look like:
Roles.new_role('Administrator', 'Admin')
:set_custom_tag('[Admin]')
:set_custom_color('red')
:set_permission_group('Staff')
:set_flag('is_admin')
:set_parent('Moderator')
:allow{
    'command/kill',
    'gui/game settings'
}

@usage--- Example System Define:
--Once all roles are defined these steps must be done to ensure the system is ready to use, this includes setting a default
--role, assigning a root (all permission) role that the server/system will use and the linear order that the roles fall into:

Roles.set_default('Guest')
Roles.set_root('System')

Roles.define_role_order{
    'System',
    'Administrator',
    'Moderator',
    'Donator',
    'Guest'
}

--Just remember that in this example all these roles have not been defined; so make sure all your roles that are used are defined
--before hand; a config file on load is useful for this to ensure that its loaded before the first player even joins.
